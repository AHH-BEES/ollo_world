oh wait, it's hello. Hello world!

System Admin/Security Consultant
coding is not my strong suit, so I'm learning to keep track and code at the same time.
stuff is messy at best, disorganized at worst, but at least it will work.
  -feel free to offer suggestions of how I can do better.
I like music and all the coffee in the world, except mocha...
